## **Attendance**

For students participating in full-time education, attending practical sessions is mandatory according to the Academic and Examination Regulations (TVSZ). **If absences exceed** one-quarter of the practical sessions — in this case, **more than 3 sessions — the course cannot be completed**. In the case of foreign scholarships or documented long-term illness, the course coordinator may authorize absences exceeding one-quarter of the practical sessions. For foreign studies, the application for a reduced curriculum must be submitted at the beginning of the semester. Missed practical sessions cannot be made up later. Attendance at practical sessions is verified by the submission of assignments uploaded by the deadline, provided that uploading is required in the practical task description. Absence from midterm exams is also considered a missed session, and attendance is verified in this case as well by the uploaded solution.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> In the case of a Covid infection, we cannot make exceptions to the above condition. Therefore, we strongly recommend that students only miss a midterm exam in highly justified cases. If one or more health issues affect two midterm exam opportunities, it may be classified as a chronic illness. However, determining this falls under the jurisdiction of the Student Services Office (HSZ), not the instructor. In such cases, we can only provide a makeup opportunity if the student has a valid, approved individual curriculum request.

## **Assessment Structure**

Throughout the semester, the material will be assessed via three closed-book exams in the computer lab, worth 35, 35, and 30 points, respectively.

Exams not written or submitted are considered absences.

Each student must take their exam during their designated lab session time.

1. **First mid-term exam:** 35 points (covering Weeks 1-5 theory and concepts)
2. **Second mid-term exam: ** 35 points (covering Weeks 7-9 theory and concepts) 
3. **Final Project:** 30 points (evaluated on functionality, design, and innovation)

During the exams, students are allowed to use one A4-sized, handwritten remider sheet  with their Neptun code and signature. Both sides of the sheet can be used. Compiling and organizing this sheet helps in learning the material, so we encourage everyone to create their own reminder without copying from others.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Only handwritten sheets can be used with signature and Neptun code inscated! 

### Assessment Rules

Assessments are conducted according to the following rules:

1. **Erroneously submitted exam solutions will not be evaluated.**
   A test submission platform is available in Moodle to practice the submission process. From this platform — similar to the live system — students can download their submitted files and verify that ZIP compression and upload were successful. This process can be practiced. Evaluating files left on lab computers after a submission error would inherently risk potential abuse.
2. **Points are only awarded for fully functional tasks.**
   There are no partial and fraction points for tasks. Tasks, along with their respective point values, are published in advance, ensuring that errors in grading can be clearly identified and corrected. This eliminates inequality arising from differing evaluations of incorrect or partial solutions.
3. **Late or non-verifiable submissions (e.g., damaged or incomplete ZIP archives) will not be accepted.**
   Students who postpone their uploads to the last moment assume the risk that potential technical issues or unforeseen circumstances may prevent submission. The faculty infrastructure ensures that all assigned tasks are solvable. Uploaded files can be downloaded and verified.
4. **Boundary cases in grading scales will always exist.**
   We kindly ask students to accept such outcomes with dignity.
5. **ECTS credits and workload:**
   One ECTS credit corresponds to 30 hours of academic work. For a 6-credit course, this translates to approximately 180 hours of effort, of which only 13 weeks × (2 lectures + 2 practice sessions) = 52 hours are delivered as contact hours. Students should allocate preparation time accordingly.

Exemptions from rules related to deadlines and other criteria could unfairly displace those at the lower end of the ranking from the scholarship. Therefore, we have endeavored to set generous deadlines and design an assessment system that minimizes the impact of unexpected events on performance. For the reasons mentioned, we do not grant exemptions from the rules.

## **Erasmus, Discounted Curriculum**

Submission deadlines also apply to those who have been exempted from attending practical sessions based on an approved request. However, in their case, it is possible to take a combined midterm exam (ZH) during the exam period if their studies abroad prevent them from attending. According to the rules for subjects concluding with a practical grade, the grade must be recorded in Neptun by the end of the first week of the exam period.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Due to the reclassification system based on academic performance between scholarship and tuition-paying places, exemptions from the above-mentioned rules are not granted based on individual discretion. It is possible that a concession in a competitive situation could push someone out of a scholarship position.

## **Contacting Instructors**

**The primary platform** for communicating with instructors **is Teams**. We kindly ask everyone to contact us through Teams instead of emails. On Teams, we can switch to voice communication or screen sharing if that is more effective.

Questions relevant to everyone should be posted in the lecture’s Teams group.
