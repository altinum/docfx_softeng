# Chessboard

Create a chessboard built off Buttons

## The modulo operator

> [!Tip]
> The `%` (modulo) operator calculates the remainder of a division. The following code snippet determines whether a number is even:

```csharp
if (a % 2 == 0)
{
	//even
}
else
{
	//odd
}
```

## Setting the background color

```csharp
 myButton = new Button();
 myButton.BackColor = Color.LightBlue;
```
