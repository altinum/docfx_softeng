## Project Presentations

The project presentations during the last lab session will be held on a one-to-one basis in five-minute slots. To help you manage your time, a schedule has been published below.

We kindly ask you to arrive 10 minutes before your scheduled appointment â€” except for the first two colleagues on the list. Please choose a lab computer, download your project from Moodle, and prepare it for presentation.

You will be asked to introduce your work using the **"Project Exam Documentation"** previously uploaded to Moodle.

If necessary, you may apply for a **make-up exam**. These will be held on **30th May**, but the exact time will be announced later, depending on the number of participants and lab availability.
