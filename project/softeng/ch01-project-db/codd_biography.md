# Edgar F. Codd

Edgar F. Codd, known as the father of relational databases, had a fascinating life and career. Some interesting aspects of his life and work:

### 1. **Early Life and Education**

- **Mathematics Background:** Codd was born in Dorset, England, in 1923. He studied mathematics and chemistry at Oxford, earning a degree in mathematics in 1942.
- **World War II Service:** During World War II, he served as a pilot in the Royal Air Force, which showcased his versatility and resilience.

### 2. **Move to the U.S. and IBM**

- **Relocation to the U.S.:** In 1948, Codd moved to the United States, where he eventually joined IBM in 1949. Initially, he worked on computing and mathematics-related problems.
- **Turbulent Start at IBM:** Codd’s early years at IBM were not directly related to databases. He initially worked on various projects, including designing hardware and working on IBM’s early computers.

### 3. **The Relational Model**

- **Revolutionary Idea:** In the late 1960s, Codd began developing his relational model of data. This idea was revolutionary because it proposed a way to organize data in a tabular form, using relations (tables) with rows and columns. His goal was to make data storage more efficient and accessible.
- **The Paper that Changed Everything:** In **1970**, Codd published his seminal paper, *A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks*. This paper introduced the world to the concept of relational databases, setting the stage for modern database systems.
- **Resistance at IBM:** Surprisingly, IBM did not initially embrace Codd’s ideas. The company was heavily invested in hierarchical and network database models at the time (IMS and IDMS). Codd had to push hard for recognition of his work within IBM.

### 4. **Impact of His Work**

- **SQL Emergence:** Though Codd did not invent SQL (Structured Query Language), the development of SQL was directly inspired by his relational model. SQL became (and still is) the standard language for interacting with relational databases.
- **Relational Database Industry:** Codd's work laid the foundation for many database systems, including IBM’s own DB2, Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and many others. The database industry, worth billions of dollars today, owes its existence to his visionary model.

### 5. **Codd's 12 Rules**

- **Standard for Databases:** To prevent misuse and dilution of his relational model, Codd formulated what became known as “Codd’s 12 Rules” (actually 13, with Rule 0) in the early 1980s. These rules set the criteria for what should qualify as a relational database.
- **Intellectual Rigor:** The rules were a testament to Codd’s insistence on maintaining the purity of his model and ensuring that databases truly adhered to the relational principles he had envisioned.

### 6. **Challenges and Later Life**

- **Recognition Came Late:** Despite his groundbreaking work, Codd was not immediately celebrated. Only after the industry widely adopted the relational model did he receive widespread recognition.
- **Turing Award:** In 1981, Codd was awarded the prestigious <u>Turing Award</u>, which is often referred to as <u>the “Nobel Prize of Computing,”</u> for his contributions to database theory.
- **Later Career:** Codd continued working at IBM and later consulted independently. However, his ideas remained central to the evolution of databases even after his retirement.

### 7. **Personal Characteristics**

- **Tenacity and Conviction:** Codd was known for his stubbornness and intellectual rigor, particularly in defending the purity of the relational model. He often clashed with IBM management over the direction of database technology.
- **Quiet and Private:** Despite his massive contribution, Codd remained a relatively private person and did not seek the spotlight. His work and ideas spoke for themselves.

Codd’s work revolutionized data management and laid the groundwork for much of today’s digital infrastructure. His persistence and dedication to a pure vision of the relational model fundamentally changed the computing landscape.
